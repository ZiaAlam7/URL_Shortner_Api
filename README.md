### Built with

- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library

### What I learned

The API Provided By Frontend Mentor Had Cors Issue Due To Which I Created A Backend Serve That Took The URL From Front End And Then Send That Data To The API And The Response Of API Was Send Back To The Frontend I Took Me Some Hours To Build That, But Then A Friend Told Me To Use Another API, One That Is Public And Free So I Used Tiny URL Which Didn't Had Any CORS Issues And I Sent The URL Directly From The Frontend Backend Was Not Required.
